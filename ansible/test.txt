1] Install Ansible on main machine

2] Configure Ansible on main machine
. cd into /etc/ansible

. nano ansible.cfg to set defaults:
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False

. nano hosts to set group and IP:
[<group>]
<ip_addr>

. whereever ansible scripts will be written, write a inventory.yaml:
<group>:
  hosts:
    <instance>:
      ansible_host: <ip_addr>

3] Configure connection to managed servers
. make ssh key in main server, share public key to managed server in "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

. use command: "ansible all -m ping"
. use command: "ansible <group> -m ping"

4] Run Ansible scripts
After testing ssh connection, run these scripts:
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml install.yaml

  ********** IMPORTANT **********
  . Before continuing Ansible, test ssh connection in cloud instance with a sample command from GitHub:
  ssh -T git@github.com
  [unless there is a way to bypass ssh security, git cloning with Ansible will not work]
